# Readme - Code Samples for Chapter 9, Language Integrated Query

**Language Integrated Query** gives you the C# language integrated query features to query data from your collections. You also learn how to use multiple CPU cores with a query and whatâ€™s behind expression trees that are used when you use LINQ to access your database with Entity Framework Core.

This chapter contains the following code samples:

* LinqIntro (showing the foundations of LINQ, showing LINQ clauses, and LINQ with extension methods)
* EnumerableSample (all the features of LINQ including filtering, grouping, joining, aggregation, lookups, using untyped collections, partitioning, compound from, and more)
* ParallelLinqSample (using parallel features including partitioners and cancellation)
* ExpressionTreeSample (working with expression trees)
