# Readme - Code Samples for Chapter 12, Reflection, Metadata, and Source Generators

**Reflection, Metadata, and Source Generators** covers using and reading attributes with C#. The attributes will not just be read using reflection, but youâ€™ll also see the functionality of source generators that allow creating source code during compile time.

This chapter contains the following code samples:

* Reflection
    * LookupWhatsNew (Reading custom attributes dynamically)
    * TypeView (Use reflection to get information about types)
    * VectorClass (Library, custom attributes annotated)
    * WhatsNewAttributes (Library, defines custom attributes) 
* Dynamic Programming
    * CalculatorLib (Library that will be loaded dynamically)
    * DynamicSamples (a custom class using *DynamicObject*)
    * ClientApp (console app loading CalculatorLib dynamically)
    * DynamicFileReader (parsing a file and making use of *dynamic*)
* Source Generator
    * CodeGenerationSample
    * SampleApp
