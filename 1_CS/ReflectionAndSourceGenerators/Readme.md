# Readme - Code Samples for Chapter 12, Reflection, Metadata, and Source Generators

**Reflection, Metadata, and Source Generators** covers using and reading attributes with C#. The attributes will not just be read using reflection, but youâ€™ll also see the functionality of source generators that allow creating source code during compile time.

This chapter contains the following code samples:

* Reflection
    * LookupWhatsNew (Reading custom attributes dynamically)
    * TypeView (Use reflection to get information about types)
    * VectorClass (Library, custom attributes annotated)
    * WhatsNewAttributes (Library, defines custom attributes) 
* Dynamic Programming
    * CalculatorLib (Library that will be loaded dynamically)
    * DynamicSamples (a custom class using *DynamicObject*)
    * ClientApp (console app loading CalculatorLib dynamically)
    * DynamicFileReader (parsing a file and making use of *dynamic*)
* Source Generator
    * CodeGenerationSample
    * SampleApp
* SourceGeneratorAsNuGet (configure the source generator package to be used as a NuGet package and not as analyzer)

## Additional information on source generators (use as NuGet package):

To automatically create a NuGet package on build (see folder `SourceGeneratorAsNuGet`):

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <GeneratePackageOnBuild>true</GeneratePackageOnBuild>
  <IncludeBuildOutput>false</IncludeBuildOutput> <!-- Do not include as a lib dependency -->
</PropertyGroup>
```

Adding the library to the `analyzers/dotnet/cs` folder, the source generator is automatically used as analyzer :

```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <None Include="$(OutputPath)\$(AssemblyName).dll" Pack="true" PackagePath="analyzers/dotnet/cs" Visible="false" />
</ItemGroup>
```
