# Readme - Code Samples for Chapter 11, Tasks and Asynchronous Programming

**Tasks and Asynchronous Programming** shows the C# keywords async and await in actionâ€” not only with the task-based async pattern but also with async streams, which is a new feature since C# 8.

This chapter contains these samples:

* TaskBasedAsyncPattern
* TaskFoundations
* ErrorHandling (error handling with async methods)
* TaskCancellation (using TaskCancellationToken)
* AsyncStreams
* AsyncWindowsDesktopApp (Windows app using the asynchronous pattern, ConfigureAwait, deadlock, IAsyncOperation)

See [WinUI](../../WinuI.md) for requirements building and deploying with WinUI.
