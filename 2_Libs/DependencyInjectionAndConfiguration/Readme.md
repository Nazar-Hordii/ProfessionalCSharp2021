# Readme - Code Samples for Chapter 15, Dependency Injection and configuration

**Dependency Injection and Configuration** gives detail about how the Host class is used to configure a dependency injection container and the built-in options to retrieve configuration information from a .NET application with different configuration providers, including Azure App Configuration and user secrets.

This chapter contains the following code samples:

* WithDIContainer (with the DI container Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection)
* WithHost (using the Host class)
* ServicesLifetime (creating scoped services, disposing of services)
* DIWithOptions (using the IOptions interface for instantiating services)
* DIWithConfiguration (using configuration files to configure the services)
* ConfigurationSample
* AzureAppConfigWebApp (configuration with Azure App Configuration)
