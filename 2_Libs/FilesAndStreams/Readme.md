# Readme - Code Samples for Chapter 18, Files and Streams

This chapter contains the following code samples:

* FilesAndFolders (using `DriveInfo`, `Path`)

* Working with Files and Folders (accessing files and directories using `File`, `Directory`, and `Path`)
* Stream Samples (`FileStream`, `StreamReader`, `StreamWriter`, `Encoding`)
* Reader Writer Samples (reading and writing binary and text files)
* Compress File Sample (compressing and uncompressing using `DeflateStream`, `ZipArchive`, and `BrotliStream`)
* File Monitor (monitoring file changes with `FileSystemWatcher`)
* JsonSample (JSON serialization, reader, writer, DOM access)
* WindowsAppEditor (an editor using WinUI)

See [WinUI](../../WinUI.md) for installing and using WinUI.

The sammple code uses a picker which currently (Project Reunion 0.5) needs to set the active window. See the InitializeActiveWindow method in MainWindow.xaml.cs. This will change with a future version and will be updated here.

The WindowsAppEditor sample needs Windows 10 and Visual Studio 2017 with the Universal Windows Platform development workload. The other samples can be used on other platforms.
