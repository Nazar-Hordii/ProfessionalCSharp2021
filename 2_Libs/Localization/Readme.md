# Readme - Code Samples for Chapter 22, Localization

In **Localization** you learn to localize applications using techniques that are important both for Windows and web applications.

This chapter contains the following code samples:

* NumberAndDateFormatting (localized format strings)
* SortingDemo (sorting with different cultures and using the invariant culture)
* CreateResource (using `ResourceReader` and `ResourceWriter`)
* WinUICultureDemo (showing all cultures and regions with a WinUI application)
* ResourcesDemo (accessing resources using `ResourceManager`)
* ASPNETCoreLocalization (using `CultureInfo` and `IStringLocalizer` with ASP.NET Core)
* WinUILocalization (localizing with WinUI)

See [WinUI](../../WinUI.md) for building and running WinUI applications.
