# Readme - Code Samples for Chapter 22, Localization

In **Localization** you learn to localize applications using techniques that are important both for Windows and web applications.

## Code Samples

This chapter contains the following code samples:

* NumberAndDateFormatting (localized format strings)
* SortingDemo (sorting with different cultures and using the invariant culture)
* CreateResource (using `ResourceReader` and `ResourceWriter`)
* WinUICultureDemo (showing all cultures and regions with a WinUI application)
* ResourcesDemo (accessing resources using `ResourceManager`)
* ASPNETCoreLocalization (using `CultureInfo` and `IStringLocalizer` with ASP.NET Core)
* WinUILocalization (localizing with WinUI)

## Updates with Windows App SDK 1.0

MRT Core APIs are now in the namespace `Microsoft.Widnwos.ApplicationModel.Resources` instead of `Microsoft.ApplicationModel.Resources`.

See [Access app resources with MRT Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/mrtcore/mrtcore-overview#access-app-resources-with-mrt-core)

## More Information

See [WinUI](../../WinUI.md) for building and running WinUI applications.
