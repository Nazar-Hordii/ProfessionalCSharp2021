# Readme - Code Samples for Chapter 19, Networking

In **Networking** you learn about foundational classes for network programming, such as the `Socket` class and how to create applications using TCP and UDP. You also use the HttpClient factory pattern to create `HttpClient` objects with automatic retries if transient errors occur.

This chapter contains the following code samples:

* Utilities
    * Utilities (using `Uri` and `IPAddress`)
* DnsLookup
    * DnsLookup (showing IP Addresses using `Dns`)
* Sockets
    * EchoServer (using sockets and pipelines to create a server)
    * EchoClient (using sockets and pipelines to create a client)
* TCP
    * TcpServer (TCP server using `TcpListener` and a custom protocol)
    * TcpClientSample (TCP client using `TcpClient`)
* UDP
    * UdpReceiver (UDP receiver using `UdpClient`)
    * UdpSender (UDP sender using `UdpClient`)
* HTTP
    * HttpServerSample (HTTP server using Kestrel)
    * HttpClientSample (HTTP client using `HttpClient`)
    * WinAppHttpClient (HTTP client with UWP app where `HttpClient` supports HTTP 2.0)
