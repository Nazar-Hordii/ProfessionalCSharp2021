# Readme - Code Samples for Chapter 30, Patterns with XAML Apps

**Patterns with XAML Apps** gives you the information you need to use the MVVM pattern and how you can share as much code as possible between different XAML-based technologies such as WinUI, WPF, and .NET MAUI.

The sample code for this chapter contains these project:

* BooksApp
* BooksLib (MVVM classes for books view-models and services)
* GenericViewModels (Generic view-model base classes)

See [WinUI](../../WinUI.md) what you need to install and develop WinUI applications.
