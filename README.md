# Professional C# 9 and .NET 5

Code samples for the Wrox Press book **Professional C# and .NET (2021 Edition)**

To compile and run the samples, you need Visual Studio 2019, Visual Studio for Mac, or Visual Studio Code. 

You can download these tools here: [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/).

The console app samples can be used on Windows, Linux, or Mac. Here is the installation procedure for .NET Core: [.NET on Linux](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core)

If you're using Visual Studio, Update x or a later version of Visual Studio 2019 is needed. With the Visual Studio Installer you need to select this workload to compile most of the code samples: **.NET Core cross-platform development**.

ASP.NET Core samples need this workload: **ASP.NET and web development**.

Windows app samples require Windows 10, Windows 10 Fall Creators Update (build TBD) or a later version. With the Windows app samples, Visual Studio 2019 Update TBD is required with this workload: **Universal Windows Platform Development**.

Compiling the Xamarin samples, you have different options using a Mac or a Windows system:
* On the Mac, you can install Visual Studio for Mac to compile the Android and iOS samples.
* On Windows 10, you can use Visual Studio 2019. To compile the iOS samples, you also need a Mac. Using only Windows 10, you can compile and run the Windows and Android code samples.
