# Professional C# and .NET - 2021 Edition

Code samples for the Wrox Press book **Professional C# and .NET - 2021 Edition**

To compile and run the samples, you need Visual Studio 2019, Visual Studio for Mac, or Visual Studio Code. 

You can download these tools here: [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/).

The console app samples can be used on Windows, Linux, or Mac. Here is the installation procedure for .NET: [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.comt)

If you're using Visual Studio, Version 16.9 or a later version of Visual Studio 2019 is needed. With the Visual Studio Installer you need to select this workload to compile most of the code samples: **.NET Core cross-platform development**.

ASP.NET Core samples need this workload: **ASP.NET and web development**.

See the [WinUI.md](WinUI.md) for the requirements of building and running the WinUI samples.

See [updates](Updates.md) for issues and updates.
